# zopyx.typesense

## What is zopyx.typesense

`zopyx.typesense` in an add-on for Plone 6 that provides an integration with
the search engine [Typesense](https://typesense.org/). The functionality is
similar with `collective.solr`.

![Typesense Features](typesense-features.png)

The reasons for using Typesense are

- very easy to install (single binary or via Docker)
- multi-field text indexes
- auto-generated (but highly customizable) search UI
- optional facted search for refining fulltext queries
- minimal invasive into Plone (does not replace the ZCatalog)
- very fast search
- extensible and customizable
- scalable (through a Typesense cluster)
- federated search over multiple collections (aka Plone sites)
- open-source
- on-premise or Typesense cloud (commercial offering)

### zopyx.typesense is not

- a replacement of the ZCatalog/portal_catalog (document changes are pushed to
  Typesense as an independent entity completely decoupled from Plone's
  portal_catalog)
- a drop-in replacement of the Plone search. zopyx.typesense comes with its own
  configurable auto-generated search UI



## Requirements

- Plone 6 (tested)
- Plone 5.2 (untested, support to work for Dexterity-only sites)

## Installation

Add `zopyx.typesense` to your buildout, re-run buildout and install it within Plone.

For Typesense installation, please check the installation docs of Typesense
(either for installation through Docker or through the standalone binary).

There is no public release at this time. You need to install `zopyx.typesense`
using `mr.developer` as source checkout from Github.
  
## Configuration

The `Typesense settings` within the Plone controlpanel:

![Typesense settings](typesense-settings.png)

- `Name of Typesense collection` - must be a unique name for the document pool
  of your Plone site
- `API Key` - the administrative API key (as configured in Typesense) 
- `Search API Key` - the search API key (as configured in Typesense) 
- `URL of Typesense node X` - the URL(s) of the Typesense node or Typesense
  cluster
- `Collection schema` - the schema of the Typesense collecton (see Typesense
  docs)

The `Typesense administration` within the Plone controlpanel:

## Search UI

![Typesense search](typesense-search.png)

The search UI is auto-generated from a minimal HTML template which defines the
basic layout together with the widgets to be used [see
here](src/zopyx/typesense/browser/search.pt).

The integration of the template with the Typesense UI generator is impleted
through some lines of Javascript code in
[src/zopyx/typesense/browser/static/app.js](src/zopyx/typesense/browser/static/app.js).


## Views

- `@@typesense-search` renders the main (auto-generated) search form. This view can be applied on
  any folder level. This view applied on a folder implies a filter by subpath (only indexed content
  with the given folder will be searched).


- `@@typesense-settings`  renders the Plone control panel of Typesense

- `@@typesense-settings`  renders the Plone control panel of Typesense

- `@@typesense-admin` renders the administration control panel for Typesense

- `@@typesense-indexed-content` applied on any arbitrary content object will
  display all data indexed for the given content object



## Transactions and eventual consistency

All indexing/unindexing operations happen asyncronously to Plone and outside
Plone's transaction system.  So, content changes might be available in
Typesense with a short delay. 

## Cavecats and known issues

- `zopyx.typesense` does not integrate (by-design) with Plone's security and
access model.  The main purpose of `zopyx.typesense` is to act as a search
engine for public sites.  So it is recommended at this time to index only
public content.

- the auto-generated pagination does not seem to work under all circumstances.
  It works if you are not authenticated, it does not work when you are logged into Plone.

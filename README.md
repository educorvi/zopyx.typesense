The reasons for using Typesense are

- very easy to install (single binary or via Docker)
- multi-field text indexes
- auto-generated (but highly customizable) search UI
- optional facted search for refining fulltext queries
- minimal invasive into Plone (does not replace the ZCatalog)
- very fast search
- extensible and customizable
- scalable (through a Typesense cluster)
- open-source
- on-premise or Typesense cloud (commercial offering)
